Hello, I’m @JaayCarrillo 
I’m a Software Development Undergrad at Grand Canyon University as a Sophmore. I have a passion for UX/UI Design and Full Stack Development. 

Some of the programming languages I have learned consist of 
* HTML/CSS/JS/Java/ C#
* Frameworks/Libraries : CSS Saas/BootStrap/jQuery/.NET 
 
I also know design tools in the Adobe Creative Suite platform and Figma. 
I’m looking to collaborate on any frontend projects to help contribute to the programming community along with building my portfolio. My goal is to get my foot in the door as a developer wether that be 
as an intern, apprentice or full time developer. 
I have a professional background in sales in the Telecommunication Industry for four years working for companies like AT&T and now T-Mobile as a Account Executive in the SMB field. 
The best way to reach me is via email or you can contact me on LinkedIn as I am also active on that platform :)
